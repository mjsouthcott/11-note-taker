## Description

This is a web application that allows users to create, save, view and delete notes. Notes consist of a title and text. When saved, new notes are added to an array of note objects, which is written to `db.json`. HTTP GET, POST and DELETE requests are routed using application methods defined in `server.js`. This application uses HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Javascript, Ajax, Node.js, Express.js and various Node.js packages.
